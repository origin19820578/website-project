        <h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency - could you have been more efficient when making your website How Could you have done it in teams?

<p>
    The main benefit of using IT tools and systems is that they are not guidelined by  one single computer. They can be used by multiple computers and systems for maximum effect. For example the use of tools like ‘Slack’ and ‘Msn Messenger’ can be implicated on different accounts with ease and allow multiple users to share information quite easily and without trouble. But like all IT tools it isn’t perfect, it requires the use of the internet and that is it’s main flaw/drawback. If a studio or office has bad internet (or the connection is cut off during weather) the use of IT tools and systems become useless to everyone who has been working hard on the project.
<p>
    In my own words it could have, as few members of the ‘teams’ would be doing research and so on.  BUT this is where the problem is, some teams could have been finished earlier than others and vise versa and so the design of the website ends up not becoming your own personal design. It becomes a ‘team’ one instead.             
</p>

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
<p>
    The best way to improve productivity/efficiency would be to meet up every morning and every evening each day for a few minutes, to discuss how the team has progressed and needs to do each day. This way it can be effective for team members to write down notes (jot down key things) which then can be a backup in case the IT services such as ‘Slack’ or ‘Trello’ are down because of difficulties. This will allow the design process to flow better with the teams as they will have a key (better) idea what to do the next day. Stopping the instight of the confusion the team might have each morning when they get in to work. 
    Another way to improve productivity would be don’t be afraid to ask, either with other teammates or with myself or my tutor. This helped me to produce my website on scheue. Although if I was in a team I could get a teammate to overlook my final design and see what they think of it. (Proofreading both the code and how the website looks)
<p> 
<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects - what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?       
<p>
    The main thing I would improve on with my own productivity is probably the use of tools like Slack or MSN Messenger to send files/ documents to get them checked over before I added them on my website.  I use GitHub <a href="https://github.com/" target = "blank">githubwebsite</a>  as well. This way my code can be checked by a range of different coders from around the world who can see things I might have missed and so tell where I need to modify the code so it works better in a professional standard. With teamwork I wouldn’t use this as much unless needed to, as you have to rely on others to do their part. Which is the main drawback to teamwork, one of your team could be sick or on holiday and so you have to carry on what they have done which takes time and energy.    
<p> 
<h4>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
<p>
    Most designers/coders when they implement a change of code need to see if the code they have changed works or not. And if it doesn’t then they need to modify the code again to make it work.  With tools like VSC (Visual Studio Code) the simplest way would be command+fn+F4 to see if the code works on the window screen. When it comes to website design (.html) the simplest way would be to command+S (which saves the code on which folder you saved it first), then find the html file and see if the file opens or doesn’t with your modifications made in VSC. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be similar to how VSC works, so the coder or designer will have to implement their code first on the .CSS file and command+S to (to save) then like with VSC they only have to test the .html page to see if the .CSS code they implemented earlier had worked or hasn’t.
