    The first thing you need to make a digital project(in fact any project) is communication.  It doesnâ€™t matter if you are working in a team or by yourself. Communication is KEY!! This way it allows you as a designer/coder to express ideas. And then those ideas and be used onto your project. Even if they can be bad. All ideas lead towards the final goal which is a finished product.

    With Skills most people need to have a good knowledge of how computing works. Or how the program (Javascript/XCode for example) they are working on to complete the project, and able to work in difficult time schemes to meet the demand that the customer wanted in their final project. If not the design feels rushed and improllery thought about.
With resources a good project team design would use as many as possible. Starting from research (which a separate team would do) a team for the development and a team for final application who would fix any bugs or glitches in the project before sending off.
