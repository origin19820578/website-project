    <p>
    Websites on the world wide web (www.) face multiple sets of problems. Most of these are little and can be dealt with without any issue with the website or it being taken down as a last resort. The main problem most websites now are finding is that most things both little and small (images/people/companies) have or are copyrighted and so need their permission to be placed on the website [7] otherwise that website has to either modify it and take down the offensive object. Or take down the website entirely. 
    <p>
    Which can cause problems themselves in the long run. With the users noticing the object that wasnâ€™t there before has been taken away because of copyright issues. Again to combat this websites now HAVE to state where the references are from. And give links to them to appropriated source links (website/name of person/company etc)[8]
