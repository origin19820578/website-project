<h1> Unit 1 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
<p>
    GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) can impact digital projects in multiple ways, since its introduction on May 25th 2018, companies now have to be very careful with how they send their data to others in email, fax, text and so on.[6] Same with digital projects, each project will have to follow multiple guidelines ranging from having the right for the project in the future to be wiped from the web in so chosen be, the right for the project to have full access at anytime by anyone if they so need be in case of security reasons. 
    GDPR also affects projects in which they have to keep all the information up to date. Wherever it is important to them or not. All of their information must be up to date.

Lastly but most importantly companies and as such digital projects have the ‘right’ to be notified in case their data (staff or projects) is stolen or ‘breached’ either by virus or hacking. In which they will have around 72 hours to respond from the being firstly noticed of the breach/hack.
