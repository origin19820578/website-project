    In depth Trello and Slack has helped wonderfully in the planning and development of the projects at my time here at Code Nation.  With these two helpfully ‘tools’ I was able to talk to my teammates/colleges to discuss any problems with our projects while we worked as a team. With Slack, It felt comfortable to use (Like Facebook messenger) so I had little or no trouble using the application to discuss any troubles on the projects myself worked on with my teammates.
<p>
    With Visual Studio Code I grasped the ideas of the program and after the explanation from my tutor at Code Nation I could understand where I messed up (as all good designers do in sometime) With XCode I felt I could use the program better than Visual Studio Code although with some practice I feel both will be up to par when searching for a coding job.

    With Git and GitHub sadly I haven’t been using the tool as much as I wanted too to save my coding on Visual Studio Code and XCode on the machine when I have been working. I acknowledge this, which in the future I would learn to use “ALL” of the tools available to full extend to help me better.
