    The main risks to digital projects are that the OS (operating System) could and does change because of how technology changes.  So in theory a app which would run on a up to date modern apple iOS could have difficulties with an obsolete version [4] and so wouldn’t work to its full effect. Other risks with projects might include problems such as companies merging together as one and so change the parameters of how the company and in term the digital project will run, or that there could be another competition in form of another company who are creating the same app (at the same time), or that a ‘key’ member of the design team left or was entice to move to another competition with better pay.
