    Like stated before the first main thing I will be doing is communication all the way through the process of making the website. Either by talking to my tutor at Code Nation to see if i’m going in the right direction, or see where I need to make errands in my website design leading to my final design.  For the actual design process I will be using my notebook to sketch how my website links to another. Creating little sketches to see if my final design will look HOW I would want it to be at the end.  Hopefully I would like to add gif files of the japanese art/video game art as backgrounds or for pictures to show that this website is mine in design. But if not I will be able to find the relevant pictures that I need on multiple search engines such as ‘Google’ and ‘Safari’ [3]
