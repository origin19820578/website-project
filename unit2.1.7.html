<h1> Unit 2 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites? </h1>
<body>
    Most websites need to be eye catching, and able to use the right type of files to allow the images available. If they don’t the images used can be unreadable or worse makes the website unreadable. To combat this sort of problem. Websites can only use a certain range of appropriate file types for images.  These include file types that use video or sound data such as (.AVI or Audio/Video Interleaved) which is the standard sound and video file on every Windows computer.  (.CSS or Cascading Style Sheet) are tools which designers for the web page itself use to maintain. (.DOC or Microsoft Word DOCument) are files which are commonly known both online and offline due to the functionality of it being able to open up on most Microsoft Word programs, both old and recent.  When users see a file called (.EXE or EXEcutable file) it means they have downloaded a program which then requires this file to open it. [11]

    (.GIF or Graphics Interchange Form) are mostly common on sites such as Facebook other social media websites. They are a small ‘moving’ video of whatever the user searched for. (.HTML/.HTM or HyperText Markup Language file) are the links used for the current website address. Mostly found at the start of the beginning of the actual website itself. (.JPG/.JPEG or Joint Photographic Experts Group File) are the files mostly used for images and can be easily accessible on every computer. (.MIDI/.MID or Musical Instrument Digital Interface) are the files used by the keyboard to communicate to the user and can be modified to each users taste and preferences so no keyboard is the same to each other.

    (.MP3 or MPEG layer 3 sound file) are the most usable files to listen to music or sounds. The file is small enough that the computer can easily recognize it and allow no trouble if downloading onto another platform/computer. (.MPEG/ .MPG or Motion Picture Experts Group file) are the types of files most commonly used today for streaming or viewing video online. It allows for a crisp service with little or few troubles online. (.MOV/ .QT or QuickTime MOVie) are video files ONLY accessible via Apple products such as their iPad or iPhone though now because of the popularity of the Apple products, it has made the transaction to other computers. (.PDF or Portable Document Format) are files such as menus to restaurants which can be open up on any computer or mobile device. But have no  differences between the original and the PDF file.
    Finally there is (.PNG or Portable Network Graphics) which can be used instead of .GIF files on websites. But act in the same way as them, which slight tweaks and modifications to the code to allow full use on the website without problems. [13]
