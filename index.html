    <h2>"About me"</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Mark Robert Dodd and currently before coming to Code Nation I was a volunteer at GoOnline, a charity who helps the elderly with any problems they might have with their laptops/mobile phones/tablets. Since I was young I have always been interested in the art aspect of video game design with the artist creation process and thoughts leading to the final design and art. This led me to acquire several different artbooks from different artists/companies (Capcom/ArcSystem Works) to help my style and help me acquire my university degree at Falmouth university in Spatial Design: Interior and Landscaping.

    <h3>"Your Interests in Technology and coding"</h3>
    <p>
    My interests in Tecnololgy and coding have been mostly in the past few years, helping the elderly if they require help. (Goonline) this requires myself to know what 
    the computer is doing or at least have a decent knowledge to help them.  With coding this is my first time and with a "few" hiccups to the point of thinking of quiting the course after the problem. But I stuck through enjoying the lessons, learning new things such as Javascript for the first time.
    I am actually enjoying the time at Code Nation and although short it was interesting to see how coding can influence a range of design aspects. such as Xcode for app design and Javascript for the actual coding.

    <h4>"What made you interested in Code Nation " 
</h4>
    <p>
        The reason why I joined Code Nation was for experience and knowledge in how designers would work in the field and to hopefully help myself as a designer with knowledge of interior and exterior design into a job in the field of coding.  As a person who has multiple disabilities including photosensitive epilepsy and cerebral palsy. It has been hard becuase most of the work required to be on the computer which is a trigger for my epilepsy. But that hasn't stopped myself to get my BA (Hons) in university it might be tough because of my condition. But I haven't stopped yet.
